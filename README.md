# Optical-Microphone
**This code was submitted for my graduation project in the College of Science.**

*This program produces sound from video that was captured without sound.*

This program works by observing and monitoring the light vibrations emanating from sounds affecting surrounding objects through a camera. These vibrations are then converted into waves through which they are resolved into sounds.
This sound is improved and purified using some algorithms integrated into this program.

These are pictures from the project presentation
